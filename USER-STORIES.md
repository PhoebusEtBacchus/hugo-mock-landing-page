# Product Description:
iSight Pro: A glasses-like VR product that can both function as a virtual reality headset and an augmented reality tool. Inconspicuously and seamlessly integrates the features of a smartphone into human vision, through genuine lenses, without resorting to video recordings displayed on a screen.

# Featured Stories
1. Working at a desk in a traditional office setting, I enjoy using iSight to build upon the capabilities of my desktop computer; I can move virtual tabs all around the office, and working for long periods of time doesn't fatigue my head thanks to the iSight's lightweight frame.

2. I often commute by walking, and appreciate that iSight allows me to view the real world--not through a video recording--while still alerting me to imminent messages or simply allowing me to change the song I am listening to without ever looking at a screen.

3. I am a frequent gamer, and the iSight has been a life saver. Now I can play for long periods of time without even realizing I'm wearing a headset--they're that light!

4. I have never had a better home theater experience than with iSight Pro! Even though the lenses are just glass, they have the capacity to fully dim so I am fully immersed in the action of my favorite films!
