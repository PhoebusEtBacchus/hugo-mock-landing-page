# Product Description:
iSight Pro: A glasses-like VR product that can both function as a virtual reality headset and an augmented reality tool. Inconspicuously and seamlessly integrates the features of a smartphone into human vision, through genuine lenses, without resorting to video recordings displayed on a screen.

# Featured Stories
1. Working at a desk in a traditional office setting, I enjoy using iSight to build upon the capabilities of my desktop computer; I can move virtual tabs all around the office, and working for long periods of time doesn't fatigue my head thanks to the iSight's lightweight frame.

2. I often commute by walking, and appreciate that iSight allows me to view the *real world*--not through a video recording--while still alerting me to imminent messages or simply allowing me to change the song I am listening to without ever looking at a screen.

3. I am a frequent gamer, and the iSight has been a life saver. Now I can play for long periods of time without even realizing I'm wearing a headset--they're that light! The touch controls and eye capture, whereby I only need look and pinch, have been miraculous, too.

# Other Stories

4. I have never had a better home theater experience than with iSight Pro! Even though the lenses are just glass--not video screens!--they have the capacity to darken fully, so that I am completely immersed in the action of my favorite films!

5. As an audiophile, I was taken aback by the audio quality output by the connected ear buds. Noise cancelling when you need them to be, but can be invisible and even amplify surrounding sound when necessary!

6. The app selection on the iSight Pro is truly amazing--while hiking, which I do often, I used one particularly useful application (out of the thousands available) to identify various flora and fauna instantaneously.
